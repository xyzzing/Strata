## Speed (measured)

RTX 5070 **12 GB**, Ryzen 5 7600 (6 cores), 64 GB DDR5-5200, Windows, engine 0.1.26 with the settings setup writes
(`--prefill auto`, 8-bit KV above 4K, KV streaming from 64K). One code-agent prompt per length, 256 generated tokens,
MTP speculative decoding on. "262K" is the model's full context window (a 259,943-token prompt). The IQ2_XS row was
measured with Swift 1.5's IQ2_XS, which runs at the original's speed.

### Prompt processing (tokens/s)

| Model | 1K | 4K | 32K | 64K | 128K | 262K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 536 | 1,299 | 2,171 | 2,126 | 2,107 | 1,304† |
| **IQ2_XS** | 534 | 1,256 | 2,092 | 1,754 | 1,752 | 1,181*† |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 482 | 1,007 | 1,745 | 1,609 | 1,602 | - |
| **IQ3_S** | 427 | 913 | 1,624 | 1,640 | 1,443 | - |
| **Coder** | 656 | 1,583 | 2,177 | 2,236 | 2,208 | 1,034** |
| **IQ3_S** (AMD RX 7900 XTX, gfx1100) | 860 | 1,350 | 602 | 1,449 | 1,403 | - |

Engine 0.1.26; `bench/results/2026-09-29-speed-0126`. At 32K-128K that is 8-28% faster than 0.1.22. † not measured
again: 0.1.22. \* measured with images on (the image encoder's VRAM reserve leaves fewer experts cached). \*\* not
measured again: 0.1.14.

### Output (tokens/s)

| Model | 1K | 4K | 32K | 64K | 128K | 262K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 87.3 | 93.0 | 81.8 | 76.2 | 73.7 | 60.3† |
| **IQ2_XS** | 79.6 | 78.6 | 76.3 | 63.7 | 62.7 | 52.8† |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 61.9 | 61.6 | 58.5 | 57.2 | 49.0 | - |
| **IQ3_S** | 52.4 | 53.3 | 48.3 | 46.3 | 45.5 | - |
| **Coder** | 58.9 | 55.1 | 54.9 | 53.2 | 43.0 | 42.8† |
| **IQ3_S** (AMD RX 7900 XTX, gfx1100) | 51.3 | 52.2 | 50.1 | 44.9 | 52.1 | - |

Engine 0.1.26, the same runs. † not measured again: 0.1.14.

Output speed depends on the text as well: speculative decoding runs faster when more of the drafted tokens are
accepted, so a different answer to the same prompt moves it by several percent. Run back to back on the 4K prompt,
0.1.14 writes 88.5 tokens/s and 0.1.12 85.7. The numbers before 0.1.13 (prompts about half as fast):
[`bench/results/2026-09-24-final`](../bench/results/2026-09-24-final/matrix.md); these:
[`bench/results/2026-09-28-speed-0114`](../bench/results/2026-09-28-speed-0114/README.md).

IQ3_XXS and IQ3_S at 262K are not measured: with their 43 / 50 GB of experts, a 260K-token context brings a 64 GB PC
to its memory limit. Use up to 128K with them on 64 GB (setup caps it). IQ3_S (engine 0.1.4 or newer) is only published
for the original model, not for Swift 1.5.

**KV streaming (engine 0.1.5):** at 64K and more, setup keeps the context's KV cache in RAM and only the part the
attention reads in VRAM (`--kv-resident 32768`), so more experts fit on the GPU. Q2_0 at 262K: 50.9 -> 62.6 tokens/s
(1,589 -> 3,872 experts in VRAM); at 128K about +6%. The attention reads exactly the same values (only where the KV lives changes); it
costs ~13.7 KB of RAM per context token (1.7 GB at 128K). Existing installs: run `START-HERE.bat --setup` once to turn
it on.

**4-bit KV cache (engine 0.1.8, optional):** `START-HERE.bat --setup` asks above 8K context (or pass `--kv q4_0`). It
halves the KV cache's memory with a Hadamard rotation before 4-bit rounding (PR #21), about 4% faster at 128K, but it
is measurably less precise on long documents (perplexity +8-12%; needle tests still pass). 8-bit stays the default.
Details: [`bench/results/2026-09-27-kv-q4`](../bench/results/2026-09-27-kv-q4/README.md).

**Hybrid K8V4 KV cache (engine 0.1.25, optional, PR #120):** `--kv k8v4` (`START-HERE.bat --setup --kv k8v4`) keeps
the keys at 8 bits and stores the values as rotated 4-bit: 23% less KV memory than 8-bit, so more experts fit in
VRAM. RTX 3090, the Coder at 198K context: 99 instead of 85 tokens/s output, the same needle results, prompts 2-5%
slower. It does not stream its KV cache (KV streaming is on by default from 64K), so it pays off mostly on large
cards at long contexts.

**The draft layer's tokens (0.1.27, `--draft-vocab`):** the MTP draft layer can only propose tokens from a subset
of the vocabulary (`mtp/rt/draft_vocab.bin`). Since 0.1.27 the subset includes every Chinese, Japanese and Korean
token (106,299 ids), so answers in those languages are 15-38% faster (Q2_0, RTX 5070). Its head takes ~180 MiB of
VRAM, which the expert cache leaves free for it (0.1.28). `START-HERE.bat --setup --draft-vocab en` keeps the
English/code subset from before (40,525 ids, ~110 MiB less VRAM, English answers 1-2% faster; CJK answers get
almost no drafts). `tools/draft_vocab.py` builds and inspects subsets.

**Low-RAM mode (engine 0.1.26, chosen by setup):** normally all of a model's experts are copied into RAM (23-50 GB,
pinned) and the GPU holds a copy of the most-used ones. On a PC whose RAM cannot hold them beside the system (the
experts plus ~10 GB), setup instead maps them from one file in the model's folder (`--mmap-experts`, the pack's
`experts.bin`, +23-50 GB of disk). The OS file cache holds what the GPU does not, and it can give that memory back.
On the Coder the engine's committed memory drops from 36 to ~13 GB, with the same answers. With a big GPU (an RTX
5090 holds all of the Coder's experts, most of Q2_0's) it runs at nearly the usual speed. With a small one, most
experts come from the SSD and it is much slower (setup says so). `START-HERE.bat --setup --low-ram on|off` overrides
the choice.

Time to first token is prompt length / prompt speed: with Q2_0 about 4 s at 4K, 25 s at 32K, under 2 minutes at 128K
and 4.5 minutes at 262K (engine 0.1.13 made long prompts about twice as fast, below).

**Faster prompts (engine 0.1.13):** the prompt is read in chunks of up to 8,192 tokens instead of 2,048 (`--prefill
auto`: the largest chunk whose buffers fit in the expert-cache slots it borrows, and a request borrows only what its
prompt needs); the experts are multiplied by llama.cpp's quantized MMQ kernels instead of being expanded to FP16
first; the next layer's experts stream over PCIe while the current layer's attention runs; the PLE block runs for the
whole chunk at once; unpinned experts are copied by helper threads. Measured on the RTX 5070 12 GB, 64 GB RAM,
32K-token prompt: Q2_0 572 -> 1,290 tokens/s, IQ3_S 383 -> 1,208. Through the server (Q2_0, 128K context): 999 tokens
353 -> 438 tokens/s, 6,927 tokens 529 -> 1,077, 28,584 tokens 584 -> 1,249. Output speed is unchanged. Needles 5/5
(1K-262K). Details and the quality check:
[`bench/results/2026-09-28-prefill-speed`](../bench/results/2026-09-28-prefill-speed/README.md). Existing installs
switch to `--prefill auto` the next time START-HERE / setup.sh starts them. The raw numbers:
[`bench/results/`](../bench/results/). The [paper](paper/Strata-Paper.pdf) explains every number.

## Other GPUs (estimated)

Not measured - estimated from the runs above (same CPU and 64 GB RAM): the GPU part scaled by memory bandwidth, the CPU
part by how many more experts the card's VRAM holds. Treat as **±20%**. Numbers are *prompt / output* tokens/s.
The prompt figures predate engine 0.1.13, which about doubled prompt speed on the measured card; how much of that a
card gains depends on its PCIe link (the experts stream over it), so they are still the older estimates.

| GPU | Model | 1K | 4K | 32K | 64K | 128K | 262K |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| RTX 5060 Ti 16GB | Q2_0 | ~341 / ~80 | ~472 / ~87 | ~501 / ~81 | ~492 / ~72 | ~476 / ~62 | ~435 / ~53 |
|  | IQ2_XS | ~291 / ~80 | ~406 / ~77 | ~434 / ~63 | ~426 / ~62 | ~413 / ~51 | ~383 / ~47 |
|  | IQ3_XXS | ~249 / ~66 | ~359 / ~65 | ~381 / ~56 | ~374 / ~54 | ~363 / ~45 | - |
| RTX 3090 24GB | Q2_0 | ~355 / ~128 | ~491 / ~140 | ~521 / ~130 | ~512 / ~115 | ~495 / ~100 | ~453 / ~85 |
|  | IQ2_XS | ~303 / ~131 | ~422 / ~128 | ~451 / ~103 | ~444 / ~102 | ~430 / ~85 | ~398 / ~78 |
|  | IQ3_XXS | ~260 / ~106 | ~374 / ~103 | ~396 / ~89 | ~390 / ~85 | ~378 / ~71 | - |

More VRAM matters more than a faster GPU: every extra GB holds ~700 more experts, and every expert on the GPU is one the
CPU does not have to compute. A 3090's 24 GB takes most of the CPU work away. (Since 0.1.14 the expert profile ranks
all 24,576 experts; before, the cache stopped at 8,000, about 10-14 GB. `tools/make_profile.py` builds a profile from
your own prompts: run the engine once with `--dump-routing trace.bin`, see the tool's help.)

## Which model?

All three are [ISTA-DASLab's GSQ-RCO quantizations](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)
of [Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next).

| Model | Download | RAM it uses | Speed | Quality |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| **Q2_0** | 66 GB | ~34 GB experts + ~6 GB | fastest | good |
| **IQ2_XS** | 68 GB | ~36 GB experts + ~6 GB | close to Q2_0 | a bit better |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 76 GB | ~43 GB experts + ~6 GB | slower (more CPU work) | best |

With 64 GB of RAM all three fit (close the browser for IQ3_XXS, and keep its context at 128K or less). With 48 GB only Q2_0 / IQ2_XS may fit. With 32 GB: the Coder (below).

### Or: the Coder (half the experts, for code)

**[Qwen3.8-Flash-Next GSQ-RCO Coder](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-Coder-GGUF)** is
ISTA-DASLab's expert-pruned release: 256 of each layer's 512 experts are kept (still 10 active per token), chosen with
RCO on code, agentic and vision calibration data; its authors report 91.3% of the full model's SWE-bench Verified and
98.7% of LiveCodeBench v6. One size, named IQ1_M for its 1.89 bits per *original* parameter; the kept experts are
stored like IQ3_S (IQ2_S-IQ4_XS gate/up, IQ4_NL/Q2_0 down). Shard 1 is 29.6 GB (experts: 23 GB of RAM), so it runs
on **32 GB of RAM**, and at 262K on 64 GB. Its shard 2 and its vision encoder are the original's files: with the
original installed, setup downloads only shard 1. Strata ships its expert profile (`data/expert-profile-coder.bin`,
the shipped ranking mapped onto the kept experts through the release's `rco-allocation.txt`: 72% of the expert
reads hit the GPU on a 12 GB card). Images work; the experimental speed projection loads and runs on it (it was made
for the full model).

```
START-HERE.bat --setup --family coder
```

### Or: Swift 1.5 (a fine-tune that thinks shorter)

The setup's first question also offers **[Swift 1.5](https://huggingface.co/ukisai/Swift-1.5-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)**,
UkisAI's fine-tune of Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, trained to reach the answer with much less thinking (its authors: 63% fewer
thinking tokens, 1.8x sooner answers, under 1% accuracy loss). Same architecture, the same three sizes, its own
vision encoder; Strata runs it at the same speed (4K, IQ2_XS: 465 prompt / 78.7 output tokens/s, vs 467 / 78.3 for
the original). Its authors recommend **IQ2_XS** (their Q2_0 is marked experimental). Its license is the Swift Open
License 1.0 - read it on the model page.

Our small check (8 reasoning questions, default thinking, IQ2_XS): both models got **8/8**; Swift used **1,234**
output tokens in 28 s, the original **2,682** in 46 s - most of the difference from one question the original
thought about for 1,524 tokens. Not a benchmark, but consistent with the claim.

```
START-HERE.bat --setup --family swift --model IQ2_XS
```

## Before you start

You need **only an NVIDIA driver** (version 580 or newer; update it with the NVIDIA App or from
[nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers)). Everything else is installed for you the first time.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| GPU | NVIDIA **RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series**, **12 GB VRAM or more** (8 GB runs, slowly). Measured on an RTX 5070 and an RTX 3090; RTX 20 (Turing, since 0.1.27) was tested by a contributor on an RTX 2070. |
| RAM | **64 GB** recommended (see the table above). |
| CPU | x86-64 with AVX2 (any Intel/AMD desktop CPU from the last ~8 years). AVX-512 (Ryzen 7000/9000) is a bit faster. |
| Disk | ~70-80 GB free for the model, ~6 GB for the MTP layer (+1 GB with images). **Q2_0 on an AVX-512 CPU** also writes a one-time ~40 GB copy of its experts for the fast CPU kernel. An NVMe SSD is strongly recommended. |
| OS | Windows 10/11, or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 get everything installed automatically). |

What the first start installs: in this folder `.venv/`, `engine/` and `third_party/`; the model files (`models/`,
`packs/`, `mtp/`, 70-120 GB) in **`Strata-data` next to this folder**, so a new copy of Strata (an update unzipped
elsewhere) finds them and sets itself up the same way. The place is remembered per user (`%APPDATA%\Strata\settings.json`,
`~/.config/strata/settings.json`); `--data-dir` chooses another. Installs from before 0.1.16 are moved there by the next
start (a rename on the same drive; files on another drive are used where they are).
Python 3.12 if you have none (for your user account, no admin), a private Python environment, NVIDIA's CUDA libraries
(from pip, ~0.4 GB), the ready-made Strata engine for RTX 20/30/40/50, the model and the MTP draft layer. If no
ready-made engine fits your PC, it offers to install the build tools (Visual Studio Build Tools + CUDA Toolkit on
Windows, `build-essential` + CUDA on Ubuntu) and compiles the engine for your GPU (asks first; 20-40 minutes once).

---

## Windows

### Double-click `START-HERE.bat`

**The first time** it asks four questions and does the rest:

1. **Which model?** Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (the original) or Swift 1.5 (the fine-tune that thinks shorter).
2. **Which size?** Q2_0, IQ2_XS or IQ3_XXS (it recommends one for your RAM).
3. **How much context?** 8K to 256K tokens (it recommends one for your VRAM).
4. **Images?** yes / no (see [Images](#images-vision)).

Then it downloads and prepares everything (the model is 66-76 GB, so the first start takes a while; an interrupted
download continues where it stopped) and **starts the model**: your browser opens `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, the Strata
app. It has three tabs:
- **Chat:** streaming answers, the model's thinking (folded away once it answers), code with a copy button, pictures when
  images are on, and sampling and thinking-level settings. Chats stay in your browser.
- **Monitor:** what the model is doing (reading the prompt, with progress, or writing, at how many tokens/s); GPU load,
  VRAM, temperature, power and PCIe traffic; CPU, RAM and disk; the context in use; the last requests.
- **About:** the model and engine settings, and the addresses to connect other apps.

`http://127.0.0.1:8080/?q=your question` opens it with a new chat already asking. The API is at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` for your apps.

**Every time after that**, `START-HERE.bat` just starts the model (30-90 s to load 34-43 GB into RAM). Nothing is
downloaded again. Closing the window stops the model.

```
START-HERE.bat --setup                          install another model, or change context / images
SETUP.bat                                       the same (double-click it)
START-HERE.bat --model IQ2_XS --context 32768 --vision yes --yes     no questions
START-HERE.bat --gguf-dir D:\models\IQ2_XS       use GGUF files you already have
START-HERE.bat --data-dir E:\Strata-data         keep the model files somewhere else
START-HERE.bat --port 8081                      another port
START-HERE.bat --gpu 1                          another GPU (numbered as nvidia-smi; setup picks the one with the most VRAM)
START-HERE.bat --calibrate                      tune the engine for this PC (about 5-10 minutes), then start
```

With more than one model installed, it asks which one to start. `run-<model>.bat` starts a model directly.

**Tuning for your PC (`--calibrate`, engine 0.1.19).** Three engine settings depend on the PC more than on the model:
- the share of the experts missing from VRAM that are copied to the GPU instead of computed by the CPU
  (`--pcie-frac`: a fast PCIe link and a slower CPU want more, a laptop's narrower link less);
- how sure the draft layer must be to add another guess to a check (`--spec-min-p`);
- how many CPU threads compute experts (`--pool-workers`: on CPUs with efficiency cores, fewer can be faster).

The defaults were measured on a Ryzen 5 7600 with an RTX 5070. Setup offers to measure them on your PC after an
install; `START-HERE.bat --calibrate` (Linux: `./setup.sh --calibrate`) does it any time. It measures the output
speed with each setting and keeps one only when it is more than 3% faster. The result is remembered per PC and model
(in the settings file next to the data folder's record), so updates keep it.

### Running it at startup (Task Scheduler)

To have the model up at logon, people start the serve from **Task Scheduler** (or a service). Beware: Windows
throttles such contexts, and the model's ~40 GB expert load then crawls at **~0.05 GiB/s (13-14 minutes)**
instead of **~1.4-1.5 GiB/s (~35 seconds)** - a 24x slower start. Measured on an RTX 5070 Ti + Ryzen 7 9800X3D
+ NVMe, same binary, same args, same cache state:

| How the serve starts | Expert load |
| --- | ---: |
| Double-click / terminal / SSH | 1.42-1.52 GiB/s (~35 s) |
| Task Scheduler with its defaults | 0.05 GiB/s (821-841 s) |
| Task Scheduler with the two settings below | 1.42 GiB/s (35 s) |

In the task's properties set both of these (the defaults are the opposite):

- **Priority level: Normal** (Options tab; the default is Below normal), and
- **Run with highest privileges** (General tab; without it the task runs with a limited user token - which
  also strips `SeLockMemoryPrivilege`, the privilege Windows large pages need).

(Both were changed at once, so the isolated effect of each is not measured.) If the model still starts
slowly, the engine prints a hint under its `loaded ... GiB at ...` line naming this cause.

### Chat in the terminal (optional)

```
.venv\Scripts\python chat.py
```

---

## Linux

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The same questions, the same automatic install (it uses `sudo apt` for Python and, only if it has to compile,
for the build tools), and the same start: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Later runs of `./setup.sh` (or `./run-<model>.sh`)
start the model directly. Options as on Windows (`./setup.sh --setup`, `--model Q2_0 --yes`, `--gguf-dir /data/Q2_0`).
Terminal chat: `.venv/bin/python chat.py`.

- **Updating:** `git pull`, then `./setup.sh`: it compiles the engine again when its source changed (a minute or
  two for the changed files). If that compile fails, it says so and starts the engine you had.
- **Other distributions** (Arch, Fedora, ...): install the C++ compiler and the CUDA Toolkit 13 with your package
  manager first (Arch: `sudo pacman -S base-devel cuda`); setup finds `nvcc` on PATH, in `/usr/local/cuda*` and in
  `/opt/cuda*`, and does the rest.
- **WSL** works (Ubuntu 24.04 tested), with one limit: the NVIDIA driver pins only about 1 GB of RAM there, so KV
  streaming (`--kv-resident`) is off and the KV cache stays in VRAM, and the experts are copied to the GPU from
  unpinned RAM (slower prompts than native Linux).

## Using it

The server listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (change with `--port` in setup, or edit the run script).

| API | Endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI Chat Completions (stream and non-stream, tools) | `POST /v1/chat/completions` |
| Anthropic Messages (stream and non-stream, tools) | `POST /v1/messages` |
| Model list / health | `GET /v1/models`, `GET /models`, `GET /health` |
| Model properties | `GET /props` (also accepts `?model=<loaded-model-id>`) |
| What the model is doing right now | `GET /status`, `GET /slots` (single slot, busy or idle) |
| Everything the Monitor tab shows (engine, live state, last requests, hardware) | `GET /metrics` |
| The MCP servers, their state and tools ([below](#tools-from-mcp-servers)) | `GET /mcp` |

`/models` and `/v1/models` list only the loaded model, with its context limit and input modalities. `/props` exposes the original chat template, context limit, configured generation defaults (shared settings take precedence), model path and engine version when available. Context means the full engine context, not the resident KV window. `n_predict: -1` means no fixed output cap. Unconfigured sampling fields are omitted. `autoload` has no effect; an unknown `model` returns 404. These metadata endpoints and `/slots` require the API key when one is configured. They do not load, unload or restart models.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": "strata", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku about GPUs."}], "max_tokens": 512 }'
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="none")
r = client.chat.completions.create(model="strata", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```

- **Thinking levels: none, low, medium, high.** The model thinks before it answers (streamed as
  `reasoning_content`, Anthropic: `thinking` blocks). Choose how much per request - in the chat page (the "Thinking"
  menu), in `chat.py` (`/think low`), or over the API:

  | API | how |
  | --- | --- |
  | OpenAI | `"reasoning_effort": "none" \| "low" \| "medium" \| "high"` (also `"reasoning": {"effort": ...}`, or `"chat_template_kwargs": {"enable_thinking": false}`) |
  | Anthropic | `"output_config": {"effort": "low" \| "medium" \| "high"}`, `"thinking": {"type": "disabled"}`, or `"thinking": {"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": N}` (under 2K = low, under 8K = medium, more = high) |

  Without a setting the model uses its own default, **high**. `none` answers at once (fastest); `low` keeps the thinking
  short. The levels are instructions the model was trained with, not a hard token limit: on easy questions all three
  think briefly, on hard ones `high` thinks longest and is most accurate.
- **Streaming.** With `"stream": true` everything arrives as it is made: the thinking, the answer, and tool calls
  (the tool's name first, then its arguments piece by piece, like OpenAI and Anthropic do). While the model reads a
  long prompt the stream sends keep-alives, so agents do not time out; the server window prints progress every
  15 s, and `GET /status` says what it is doing (`reading the prompt`, `answering`, tokens so far). Closing the
  connection or pressing stop in your app really stops the model, so the next request starts at once.
- **Chat apps.** Any app with an "OpenAI-compatible" provider works: base URL `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1`, any API key.
- **Claude Code** (Strata 0.1.17 or newer): set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080` and
  `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` to a Claude model name it knows (it refuses names it doesn't; Strata ignores the name), plus any
  `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` (or your `api_key`, if you set one).
- **Context.** Chosen in setup (8K-262K). Requests longer than that are refused, never silently cut. A request whose
  `max_tokens` would run past the context is refused too (400); agents that always ask for their full output cap
  can instead get it shortened to the room left: add `"fit_max_tokens": true` to `strata-<model>.json` (or pass
  `--fit-max-tokens` to `serve/server.py`). A prompt that leaves no room at all is still refused.
- **From other devices on your network.** The server listens on your PC only (`127.0.0.1`) unless you say otherwise:
  run setup with `START-HERE.bat --setup --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key some-long-secret` (or add `"host": "0.0.0.0"` and
  `"api_key": "..."` to `strata-<model>.json`). The server window then prints this PC's addresses
  (`from other devices: http://192.168.x.x:8080/`); open that on the other device, or use `.../v1` as an API base URL.
  On Windows the firewall blocks it until you allow it: accept its prompt for Python (private networks), or run
  `New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Strata 8080" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8080 -Action Allow -Profile Private`
  in an admin PowerShell, and make sure the network is set to Private.
- **From the internet.** Put a tunnel in front of it, for example [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/do-more-with-tunnels/trycloudflare/):
  `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8080`. **Set a key first**, or anyone with the link can use your PC:
  add `"api_key": "some-long-secret"` to `strata-<model>.json` (or set the `STRATA_API_KEY` environment variable);
  clients then send it as their API key.

**Conversation cache.** A request that continues a chat reads only the part after what the engine already holds: the
live session, or one of the checkpoints it keeps in RAM (up to 6, ~118 MB each, taken at the start of each new
assistant turn and every 16K prompt tokens). A checkpoint is used only when the prompt starts with exactly its tokens
and pictures. The oldest checkpoint - in practice the end of the system prompt, which every chat of the same client
shares - is kept for good while the rest rotates by least recent use, so a NEW chat that shares that prefix starts
reading after it instead of from token 0. A prompt read from the start is also checkpointed at the end of its system
prompt when that is 2,048 tokens or more (engine 0.1.20; PR #62 + #65), so that root exists for agent clients with long
system prompts and tool lists. Engine options: `--prompt-cache N` (0 = off), `--prompt-cache-every N`,
`--prompt-cache-root N` (0 = no system-prompt checkpoint), `--turn-token ID`.

**Current limits (v1):** one request at a time, and one conversation's history in the KV cache at a time (switching
between two chats re-reads the part where they diverge; the shared prefix, such as the system prompt, is reused); images
only when set up with them (below); no video. **Temperature / top_p / top_k / min_p /
seed** are honored per request (OpenAI and Anthropic fields); with the default adaptive expert tier a sampled result
is not reproducible run to run - for seed-reproducible output add `--adapt-every 100000` (static residency) to the
engine arguments. The run config's optional `sampling` block sets the defaults for requests that leave the fields out
(`"sampling": {"temperature": 1.0, "top_p": 0.95, "top_k": 20}`); a request's own fields always win, and with no
block at all a request without sampling keys decodes greedy. The penalties (`presence_penalty`, `frequency_penalty`,
`repetition_penalty`, with `penalty_last_n` capping how many recent tokens they count over, default 64 when any
penalty is set) ride the same path; they count the tokens the request has consumed, so a repetition penalty
suppresses what the model itself just said, not the prompt alone. Since engine 0.1.19 they apply to every token
the speculative decoding checks at once, exactly as if it decoded one token at a time (before, only the first of
each batch got them). That makes requests with penalties 1-11% slower than in 0.1.18: the draft layer guesses
without penalties, so more of its guesses are now rejected. Requests without penalties are unchanged. `top_k` keeps at most 64 candidates: `0` ("off") or anything above 64 uses all 64.

## Tools from MCP servers

The chat page can give the model tools from [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers, as LM Studio and Claude
Desktop do: reading your files, fetching web pages, searching, anything an MCP server offers. List the servers in
`strata-<model>.json` under `"mcp_servers"` - the same shape as Claude Desktop's `mcpServers` block, which you can
also paste as it is (key `"mcpServers"`):

```json
"mcp_servers": {
  "files": {"command": "npx", "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "C:\\Users\\me\\Documents\\notes"]},
  "search": {"url": "http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp", "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ..."}}
},
"mcp": {"timeout_s": 60, "max_result_chars": 20000, "max_rounds": 8}
```

Or keep them in their own file and start the server with `--mcp-config path\to\claude_desktop_config.json` (a file
with an `mcpServers` block; add it to the `serve/server.py` line of your run script). Restart Strata after a change.

- **A program** (`command`, `args`, optional `env` and `cwd`) is started by Strata and spoken to over its
  stdin/stdout; `npx`, `uvx`, `python` and friends are found on `PATH` as usual (Node.js is needed for `npx`
  servers). **An address** (`url`, optional `headers`) uses MCP's Streamable HTTP transport (the older SSE-only
  transport is not supported). `"disabled": true` leaves an entry out.
- The servers start with Strata, in the background; the server window says what each one offers
  (`MCP server 'files': 14 tools (...)`), or why it did not start - its tools are then left out and the chat works
  without them. The Monitor tab lists them, and the Sampling drawer has **Use tools from MCP servers** (on by
  default). A server that stops later is started again at its next call.
- In the chat each call shows as a small block (tool, arguments, result); the model reads the result and goes on,
  up to `max_rounds` calls in a row per answer. A tool that fails or takes longer than `timeout_s` (default 60 s)
  gives the model an `error: ...` result instead of ending the chat. Results longer than `max_result_chars`
  (default 20,000 characters) are cut, with a note, before the model reads them. Stop stops a running tool too.
- Only the chat page uses them. API clients (omp, Claude Code, OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs) see the API exactly as
  before and keep their own tools; a request to `/v1/chat/completions` opts in with `"strata_mcp": true` (it then
  gets `strata_mcp` tool events in the stream).

**Security.** MCP tools run on your PC with your user's rights, and **the model decides when to call them** - also
because of what it reads (a web page or a file can contain instructions). Give a filesystem server only the folders
it needs, prefer read-only tools, and don't add servers you don't trust. The tools can only be used from the chat
page itself (a request with another site's Origin or without a JSON content type is refused); if Strata is reachable
from other devices, set an API key.

## Images (vision)

The model has a vision encoder: [`mmproj-Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-BF16.gguf`](https://huggingface.co/ISTA-DASLab/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GSQ-RCO-GGUF)
(0.9 GB, a 27-layer ViT plus the projector into the language model). It is **optional**: say yes when the setup asks
"Images?", or run it again with `--vision gpu` (or `--vision cpu`). The setup downloads the encoder, builds a small
helper (`strata-vision`, from llama.cpp's `mtmd` library) and adds it to your start script. Nothing else changes.

| Encoder on | Time per picture | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GPU** (recommended) | **0.1-0.5 s** (up to 1,024 image tokens) | ~1.4 GB of VRAM is kept free for it, so the expert cache is smaller: text output is a few % slower (table below) |
| CPU | 10-30 s (pictures are scaled down to ~300 image tokens) | nothing on the GPU |

A picture becomes up to 1,024 tokens of the context (a 640x480 photo: 300). The same picture sent again, as chat apps
do on every turn, is encoded only once.

### Sending a picture

**Terminal chat:** type `/image <path to a picture>`, press Enter, then type your question.

```
you> /image C:\Users\me\Pictures\receipt.jpg
(picture attached: receipt.jpg - now type your question)
you> What is the total on this receipt?
```

**OpenAI API** (an `image_url` part: a `data:` URL, an `http(s)://` URL or a local file path):

```python
import base64
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="none")
img = base64.b64encode(open("photo.jpg", "rb").read()).decode()
r = client.chat.completions.create(model="strata", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": [
    {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{img}"}},
    {"type": "text", "text": "What is in this picture?"}]}])
print(r.choices[0].message.content)
```

**Anthropic API:** an `image` block with a `base64` (or `url`) source, as usual.

JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, WebP, TIFF and AVIF work (the last ones are converted to PNG first; agents such as omp send
WebP). Chat apps with image upload work the same way.

### Speed with images on (4K context, measured)

| Model | Prompt tok/s, images off | Prompt tok/s, images on | Output tok/s, images off | Output tok/s, images on |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 541 | 531 | 90.7 | 86.9 |
| **IQ2_XS** | 468 | 458 | 77.1 | 74.0 |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 411 | 401 | 64.7 | 59.5 |

"Off" is the published setup; "on" runs with the encoder loaded on the GPU and its VRAM kept free, so ~1,000 fewer
experts fit in VRAM and the CPU computes a few more per token: 2-8% slower. For text, turning images on changes
nothing else (the output is bit-identical when the VRAM is the same).

A question about a picture (a 640x480 newspaper page = 300 image tokens, a 328-token prompt; the whole request, encoder
on the GPU, measured through the API):

| Model | Answer ("MEN WALK ON MOON") | Picture encoded | Prompt | Output |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| **Q2_0** | 1.9 s | ~0.1 s | 207 tok/s | 65-73 tok/s |
| **IQ2_XS** | 2.3 s | ~0.1 s | 173 tok/s | 50-60 tok/s |
| **IQ3_XXS** | 2.7 s | ~0.1 s | 144 tok/s | 41-50 tok/s |

(Short prompts run below the 4K prompt speed: a 2,048-token chunk is where the prompt path is efficient. Short answers
run below the long-output speed: the first rounds have no draft yet.)

**How it works inside:** the encoder turns the picture into rows of the same width as the model's word embeddings;
Strata puts them where the prompt has `<|image_pad|>` tokens and gives each one its 2-D position (row and column in the
picture; the model uses interleaved M-RoPE). Answers match llama.cpp's multimodal implementation token for token on our
test images.

## Experimental speed projection (EXPERIMENTAL, off by default)

**This is an experiment, not a finished feature.** It ships with Strata but stays off unless you turn it on.

A 480 KB control vector for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`data/experimental-speed-projection/`, see its README). After each
of layers 4-44 the engine removes one direction from every hyper-connection stream of the residual: `h -= (h . v) v`,
one unit vector `v` per layer, exactly as llama.cpp does with the package's `--cvec-mode project` patches.

**What it changes.** The vector's own package describes it as a **refusal-direction projection**: with it the model
declines far fewer requests (it reports 1 of 50 vs 50 of 50 on its test set), and removing refusals removes a safety
behaviour - you are responsible for what the model writes with it on. It also shifts ordinary answers a little
(measured below). It is not an optimization in the engine: on the same text it costs 0.2-0.4% per token. What a
chat's tokens/s does with it on depends on the text the model writes (length, repetition, how well the drafts land),
so measure it on your own prompts; the Monitor marks every request ESP or stock.

**Turning it on (at setup).** `START-HERE.bat --setup` asks "Turn on the experimental speed projection?" (default:
no), or pass `--experimental-speed-projection on` (`off`, or a path to another vector GGUF). Only for the original
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, not Swift 1.5. It writes these engine flags (llama.cpp's) into `strata-<model>.json`:

```
--control-vector-scaled <Strata>\data\experimental-speed-projection\Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-experimental-speed-projection.gguf:1.0
--control-vector-layer-range 4 44 --cvec-mode project --cvec-dir per-layer
```

The engine log then says `control vector mode = project, dir = per-layer, layers 4..44 (41 steered)`, and the web
app's About tab lists it. (`--cvec-mode add` is llama.cpp's stock additive mode, for additive vectors.)

**Per request.** A loaded vector is on for every request unless it says otherwise: the web app's Sampling drawer has
a switch, and the API takes `"experimental_speed_projection": false` in the request body (OpenAI and Anthropic; a
config default goes in `"sampling": {"experimental_speed_projection": false}`). Switching drops the conversation
cache once, since the model state was computed the other way. Switched off, the output is token-for-token the stock
model's.

**Measured here** (Q2_0, fixed experts, 2,557 teacher-forced tokens of code, a document and a chat): the top-1 token
changes at 10% of positions, mean KL from the stock model 0.063 nats (max 4.1), perplexity +15% on code, +2.3% on
the document, +0.4% on the chat. Details: `bench/results/2026-09-27-esp/`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| `the NVIDIA driver is too old` | Update the driver (NVIDIA App or nvidia.com/drivers), restart, run `START-HERE.bat` again. |
| Python or the build tools could not be installed | Install what it names (links are printed), then run it again. Everything already done is kept. |
| `port 8080 is already in use` | Strata is already running (look for its window), or another program uses the port: `START-HERE.bat --port 8081`. |
| `cudaHostRegister ... out of memory` in the log | Normal on Windows: the engine pins the experts in per-layer slices instead. Only a problem if the load then fails. |
| `ExpertCache: cudaMalloc(...) failed: out of memory` although VRAM is free | Windows' page file is off or tiny: every allocation on the graphics card is also charged to Windows' commit (RAM + page file). Set the page file to "System managed" (System > About > Advanced system settings > Performance > Advanced > Virtual memory) and restart. Since 0.1.19 the engine retries with a smaller cache instead of stopping, and setup warns about a page file under 4 GB (issue #60). |
| The first start takes minutes | It is reading 34-55 GB into RAM; the second start is faster while the files are in the OS cache. |
| The PC freezes for a few minutes at the start | Normal, most of all the first time (the server window says when it happens): the engine loads the experts into RAM, pins part of it for the GPU and sizes the expert cache. Wait; don't close the window. Still frozen after 10 minutes: restart the PC, close other programs, try again, or pick a smaller size. |
| `the engine stopped unexpectedly (exit code ...)` | The engine process ended mid-answer - usually out of RAM (Linux ends the biggest program: `sudo dmesg \| grep -i -E 'killed process\|out of memory'`). The next request starts it again by itself. If it repeats: close other programs or pick a smaller size. The server also warns at start when the model's experts leave less than ~6 GB of RAM for everything else. |
| Slow output, disk light busy | Not enough free RAM: close other programs, or choose Q2_0 / IQ2_XS. |
| `prompt ... exceeds the context` | The request is longer than the context you chose: run setup again with a bigger `--context`. |
| Slower than the tables | The monitor plugged into the GPU and other GPU programs take VRAM from the expert cache; RAM running below its rated speed (enable EXPO/XMP in the BIOS) slows the CPU half. |
| `this server was started without the vision encoder` | The model was set up for text only: run setup again with `--vision gpu`. |
| A picture is refused or `cannot read the image` | The file is not a picture Pillow can open (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, BMP, TIFF, AVIF work). |
| Pictures are slow (10-30 s) | The encoder runs on the CPU: run setup again with `--vision gpu` (needs ~1.4 GB of VRAM). |
| A request never finishes: "reading the prompt", GPU "100%" at low power | The GPU ran out of VRAM (engines before 0.1.9 could end with ~30 MiB free at large contexts). Run `START-HERE.bat` once to get engine 0.1.9 or newer; the log then says `... MiB of VRAM free with everything loaded` (a few hundred) and names the `--vram-reserve-mib` to add if it is low. |
| Generation stops mid-answer, GPU "100%", one CPU core busy | Fixed in engine 0.1.12 (issue #29, a race in the CPU expert pool on big-VRAM cards). Since then a request that stops moving ends with an error instead of hanging (after 2 minutes; 1 minute from 0.1.13): the log says `no progress for ... s ... (issue #29)` with where it stopped, and the next request starts the engine again. If you see that line, please open an issue with it. Engine 0.1.13 adds a stall report under it (what every expert-pool thread and the GPU handshake were doing, memory and page faults) and, on Windows, a `strata-stall-<pid>.dmp` file with every thread's stack: attach both. (`STRATA_WATCHDOG_S` sets the time in seconds; 0 turns it off.) Engine 0.1.14 fixes the stall those reports found (issue #31: with the IQ packs the host could wait forever inside the NVIDIA driver while copying experts in a verify window; the experts are now copied by a GPU kernel, `--pcie-mode dma` restores the old way). |
| `out of memory: cudaFuncSetAttribute` in the log (IQ3_XXS, long prompt) | Fixed in engine 0.1.15: CUDA loaded a kernel's code when it was first needed, and mid-prompt there was no VRAM left for it. Run `START-HERE.bat` (Windows) or `./setup.sh` (Linux) once to update. |
| Anything else | The engine log is `strata-<model>.log` in this folder. |

## How it works

<p align="center"><img src="paper/tiers.svg" width="760" alt="memory tiers"></p>

- **GPU (VRAM):** attention and DeltaNet mixers, the gated-residual weights, routers, shared experts, output head, the MTP
  draft layer, the KV cache (from 64K: only its most-read part, the rest streams from RAM), and an **expert cache** that fills the rest of VRAM with the most-used experts (it adapts to
  the conversation while you chat).
- **RAM:** all 24,576 experts, pinned. The CPU computes the experts that are not on the GPU **in place**, at the same time
  as the GPU works on the cached ones (AVX-512 / AVX2 kernels, ggml's for the i-quants).
- **SSD:** the 28.8 GB n-gram table, read a few rows per token through the OS cache.
- **Speculation:** the model's own MTP layer drafts up to 3 tokens; one pass over all 48 layers checks them. 2.4-3.2
  tokens per pass on average. When the reply repeats the context (code edits, quoted text), **prompt lookup** (engine
  0.1.7) drafts up to 5 tokens from the earlier copy, but only where its measured acceptance and cost say it pays:
  code edits 6-11% faster, other text unchanged. The drafts are checked like the MTP's, so the output is the same.
- **Prompts** are processed in 2,048-token chunks with the experts streamed to the GPU over PCIe.
